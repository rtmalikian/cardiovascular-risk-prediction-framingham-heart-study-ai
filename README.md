# Cardiovascular Event Risk Prediction Tool

A web-based clinical decision support tool using Python and Streamlit to predict 10-year cardiovascular event risk, aligning model output with the Framingham Heart Study large dataset.

## Overview

This project develops a machine learning model to predict cardiovascular event risk based on the Framingham Heart Study dataset. The tool provides real-time AI inference through an interactive web interface, designed for clinical decision support.

### Features

- Interactive web interface built with Streamlit
- Machine learning model trained on Framingham Heart Study dataset
- Real-time cardiovascular risk prediction
- Data visualization and interpretation tools
- User-friendly input controls for risk factor assessment

## Data Wrangling Achievement

Successfully cleaned, organized, and trained a machine learning model on a large, complex medical database, demonstrating the ability to manage and structure highly heterogeneous medical data for real-time AI inference.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/framingham.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
